# ATM_Pin_Verification

This project was done at the end of our IoT training by Kernel Sphere Pvt. Ltd. Here 8x2 LCD display and 4x4 Keypad were connected over an Arduino. I wrote an Arduino program that verifies if a user entered the correct Pin. There are only 3 attempts after which will have to wait for 10mins to re-enter the password.
